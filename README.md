# Hacker-Related-Python-Scripts
These are short simple scripts that are hacking-related. Use at your own risk, as hacking is obviously illegal.

I have many scripts here, ranging from some simple DDoS Scripts(My modified Saphyra Script is the most powerful one) to making malware and RAT's.

If you do choose to cause any damages, I will not be the one responsible.

This Repository is at the end of its life-span. I have created much more advanced scripts than the ones here, and I wish to create another repository for said scripts.
